# Experience
___________
Google (via Adecco) <br>
GIS Operations Lead<br>
Sept. 2013-present<br>
- Contractor at Google campus via Adecco
- Conducting GIS analyses of aerial and satellite imagery coverage/quality and presenting results to management for
planning decisions and strategy. Used Maps API to create automatically up-to-date interactive coverage maps.
- Responsible for ordering huge volumes of satellite imagery each quarter from several providers while ensuring that
orders meet specifications, responding to user requests and quality issues, and ensuring that only the most impactful imagery is ordered.
- Lead production efforts for the first statewide imagery resale deal, including processing and delivery of over 35 TB of data for customers in Google Maps Engine/Cloud Platform.
- Wrote a Python application (GDAL/OGR) to completely automate the resale program’s coverage analysis process.
- Monitoring daily production and quality of data sets.
- Collaborating with external partners and multiple engineering groups to ensure data meets project specs and flows through pipeline from collection to production.

<br>
SETI Institute<br>
Research Assistant<br>
Sept. 2012-Jan. 2014<br>
- Conducted remote sensing research on the surface geology of Mars through the use of photogrammetry and hyperspectral data (from the CRISM instrument aboard the MRO satellite). Use of ENVI, Google Earth/Mars, and ArcGIS software.
- Used ArcGIS to assemble 3D image mosaic maps of Mars multispectral data.
- Maintained a database of laboratory spectral data, and used Python scripting in GIS programs to automate data conversion tasks.
- Published a manuscript in a major scientific journal (see Skills section) and presented at several conferences.

<br>
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)<br>
USRP Student Intern<br>
Aug. 2011-Dec. 2011<br>
- Tested and demonstrated the capabilities of the Multispectral Microscopic Imager (MMI) instrument and identified areas of improvement.
- Used ENVI software to process the MMI spectral data and basic LabVIEW programming to improve the instrument user interface. 

<br>
NASA Ames Research Center<br>
INSPIRE Student Intern<br>
Summer 2008<br>
- Analyzed major sources of greenhouse gas emissions in California by economic sector through literature analysis and determined where gaps in our knowledge of emissions exist.
- Collaborated with NASA scientists and employees to determine how NASA observational and modeling capabilities could provide information to the state.
