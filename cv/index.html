GIS Operations Lead<br>
Sept. 2013-present<br>
- Contractor at Google campus via Adecco<br>
- Conducting GIS analyses of aerial and satellite imagery coverage/quality and presenting results to management for
planning decisions and strategy. Used Maps API to create automatically up-to-date interactive coverage maps.<br>
- Responsible for ordering huge volumes of satellite imagery each quarter from several providers while ensuring that
orders meet specifications, responding to user requests and quality issues, and ensuring that only the most impactful imagery is ordered.<br>
- Lead production efforts for the first statewide imagery resale deal, including processing and delivery of over 35 TB of data for customers in Google Maps Engine/Cloud Platform.<br>
- Wrote a Python application (GDAL/OGR) to completely automate the resale program’s coverage analysis process. <br>
- Monitoring daily production and quality of data sets. <br>
- Collaborating with external partners and multiple engineering groups to ensure data meets project specs and flows through pipeline from collection to production.
